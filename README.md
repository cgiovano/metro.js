# metro.js
A metronome app using web.

- Does not support microsecond time precision, just millisecond precision.

To do:
- add the function to change the color of UI (actually the app has the dark mode).
- store the user preference for the theme.
- for the future i am planning to add a tuner into the application.
- convert the entire application to an electron app.
